### *SIMPLE* genetic algorithms for fun and practice

## circles
genetic algorithm to find biggest circle that fits in field of circles without overlap

## rects:
like circles above, but with rectangles (has 1 extra gene: instead of radius, had height and width)

## maze
genetic algorithm to find route through simple grid maze 
(fitness - for hitting walls, + for successful move?, ++ for hitting target 'quadrants', +++ for goal)

## pred/prey?
borrow ideas from evolvers graphic thing...but use one predator at a time and a bunch of prey each generation...
